# Modularity and Dependency Management

##### _(Part II, Chapter 5)_

During this chapter we'll be focusing on **modular design**. We'll learn about code encapsulation, information hiding, dependency management, and package management. The chapter also covers what's coming in _Harmony_, the upcoming EcmaScript specification, which comes with a few nice new tricks for modular application building. These are the samples as discussed through the chapter, in the same order of appearance.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
