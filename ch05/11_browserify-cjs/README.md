# Browserify: Take your Common.JS packages for a ride!

[![browserify.png][1]][2]

[Browserify][2] is a pretty awesome tool authored by [@substack][3], which allows you to bring CJS packages into the browser. In [the book][4] we introduce the concept, and then compare it to RequireJS.

The [grunt-browserify][5] plugin has a really interesting read which is worth checking out, talking about the benefits of using CJS modules.

Once you've built, open the example from your shell, using:

```shell
google-chrome test.html
```

<sub>(or just open `test.html` in your favorite browser)</sub>
