# Using RequireJS

![requirejs.png][1]

[Require.js][2] is a JavaScript _module loading_ library. Popularized by @jrburke, this script loader is one of many ways to address [dependency hell][3] in client-side JavaScript.

This sample depicts the basic usage form of the module loader, while the book analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of using it. Run the example from your shell, using:

```shell
google-chrome test.html
```

<sub>(or just open `test.html` using your favorite browser)</sub>

Note that this sample merely outputs a few values to the developer console.
