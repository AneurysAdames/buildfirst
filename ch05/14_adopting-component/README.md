# Adopting Component

[![component.png][1]][2]

For information about _other_ front-end package management options, check out [this repository][3].

This example briefly demonstrates how we can benefit from using the [Component package manager][2]. Install it with the following command.

```shell
npm install -g component
```

That will install the `component` program itself. To install packages in `component.json`, merely use:

```shell
component install
```
