# Asynchronous JavaScript

##### _(Part II, Chapter 6)_

During this chapter we'll be focusing on **managing asynchronous complexity**. You'll be learning about callback-based asynchronous tasks, queues, promises, events, and _ES6 generators_. These are the samples as discussed through the chapter, in the same order of appearance.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
