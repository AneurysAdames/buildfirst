# Asynchronicity and Generators

![es6.png][2]

To run the generator examples, you should get Node [`v0.11.10` or later][2], which you can easily fetch, install, and use, with [nvm][3]. Then, you must pass the `--harmony` flag to the `node` CLI when executing a script, that'll enable ES6 features such as generators, including the `function* ()` construct, the `yield` keyword, and the `for..of` construct.
