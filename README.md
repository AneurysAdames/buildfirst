# Build First: JavaScript Applications

_**Accompanying code samples and snippets for the Build First: JavaScript Applications book.**_

This are the accompanying code samples and snippets for a book I wrote about **JavaScript build processes and application architecture**. Want to [_learn more about it_](http://bevacqua.io/buildfirst "Build First: JavaScript Applications")?

# Installation

You'll need **Node.js**, refer to [this link](http://nodejs.org/download/ "Node.js Downloads") to install it.
You'll also need to clone this repository, make or change directory to your development folder, and then clone this repository.

I use a little utility developed by **GitHub**, called [hub](http://hub.github.com/ "hub by GitHub"), to easily clone repositories.

```shell
cd /dev/repo
hub clone bevacqua/buildfirst
```

You won't need to install dependencies for the examples using `npm install`, because the `node_modules` folders are bundled with the repository, for convenience.

If you don't want to install hub you can simply use [git](http://git-scm.com/ "git source control").

```shell
cd /dev/repo
git clone https://github.com/bevacqua/buildfirst.git
```

# Execution

To run an example, read its [README.md](README.md "To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion") and follow the instructions I've placed there. I tried to make them as straightforward as possible, but sometimes they might not match the examples in the book to the letter.

There are some examples here that you _won't find on the book_, those will generally be a bit longer: the reason why I didn't include them in the book. Although the code itself might not be present in the book, most of the explaining will definitely be there, rather than here.

# Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/bevacqua/buildfirst/issues). Maybe it's something that needs fixing.

# Feedback

You can drop me a line at `nicolasbevacqua@gmail.com` if you want to leave me feedback, say hi, or grunt at me about my failure to amuse you.

I'm also reachable through my [blog](http://blog.ponyfoo.com "Pony Foo"), [@nzgb](https://twitter.com/nzgb "@nzgb on Twitter") on Twitter, and I enjoy people stalking me over the Internet.

Let the [**#buildfirst**](https://twitter.com/#buildfirst) revolution commence!
