# Build First: JavaScript Applications

##### _Accompanying code samples and snippets for the Build First: JavaScript Applications book._

# Installation

You'll need **Node.js**, refer to [this link](http://nodejs.org/download/ "Node.js Downloads") to install it.
You'll also need to clone this repository, make or change directory to your development folder, and then clone this repository.

I use a little utility developed by **GitHub**, called [hub](http://hub.github.com/ "hub by GitHub"), to easily clone repositories.

```bash
cd /nico/dev/git
hub clone bevacqua/buildfirst
```

You won't need to install dependencies for the examples using `npm i`, because the `node_modules` folders are bundled with the repository. Contrary to popular belief, this is the recommended practice.

# Execution

To run an example, read its [README.md](README.md "To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion") and follow the instructions I've placed there. I tried to make them as straightforward as possible, but sometimes they might not match the examples in the book to the letter.

There are some examples here that you _won't find on the book_, those will generally be a bit longer: the reason why I didn't include them in the book. Although the code itself might not be present in the book, most of the explaining will definitely be there, rather than here.

# Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues please create an issue here, maybe it's something that needs fixing.

# Feedback

You can drop me a line at `nicolasbevacqua@gmail.com` if you want to leave me feedback, say hi, or grunt at me about what a sloppy job of amusing you I did.

I'm also reachable through my [blog](http://blog.ponyfoo.com "Pony Foo"), [@nzgb](https://twitter.com/nzgb "@nzgb on Twitter") on Twitter, and I enjoy people stalking me over the Internet.
