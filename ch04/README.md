# Chapter 4

In this chapter we cover release-grade environments, such as `staging`, and `production`. We also go over deployment, application monitoring, logging, and continuous integration practices. These are the samples as discussed through the chapter, in the same order of appearance.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
