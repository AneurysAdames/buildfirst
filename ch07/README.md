# Patterns, Practices, and Refactoring

##### _(Part II, Chapter 7)_

In this chapter, the focus is on modular application building, with a twist. Rather than focus on how to organize our files themselves, which we've already discussed at length in [Chapter 5][1], we'll learn all about the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern

These are the samples as discussed through the chapter, in the same order of appearance.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
