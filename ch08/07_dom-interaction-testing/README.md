# DOM Interaction Testing

![mind-the-gap.jpg][1]

Testing the interaction between the DOM and JavaScript code can be complicated. This example sets up a _Event Bar_, where numbers go to get a round.

In order to run the example, you'll need to browserify the client-side code, first.

```shell
grunt build
open .
```

Here is the _Event Bar_ in all its glory.
