# Your First Mocha Test!

Writing JavaScript unit tests honestly isn't that hard, and Mocha makes it even easier! It's pretty well documented as well, so you might want to [take a look at their documentation][1] to better understand how to customize your unit testing experience.

The first thing you'll want to do here is install the `mocha` CLI globally, so it gets added to your system `PATH`.

```shell
npm install -g mocha
```
