# LESS Task

This example shows how to configure the Uglify Grunt task, as discussed in chapter 2 of the book. 

In the example, we'll be setting up minification for a JS file. When we run it, the file will be minified and placed into a `build/` folder.

To run this example, enter the following command in your terminal.

```bash
grunt uglify:js
```
