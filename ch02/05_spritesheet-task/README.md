# Spritesheet Task

![spritesheet.png][1]

This example shows how to configure the `sprite` Grunt task provided by `grunt-spritesmith`, as discussed in Chapter 2 of the book. 

In the example, we'll be setting up image spriting. This is something that's very common in game-engine land. Think of it as asset bundling for images.

To run this example, enter the following command in your terminal.

```shell
grunt sprite:icons
```

That will generate the necessary CSS and the spritesheet image.

A more complete example can be found at [bevacqua/grunt-spriting-example](https://github.com/bevacqua/grunt-spriting-example), as it also has a view, a server that serves the view, and some CSS so that you can **start to use spritesheets immediately**!
