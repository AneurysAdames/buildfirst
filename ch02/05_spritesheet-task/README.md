# Spritesheet Task

This example shows how to configure the `sprite` Grunt task provided by `grunt-spritesmith`, as discussed in Chapter 2 of the book. 

In the example, we'll be setting up image spriting. This is something that's very common in game-engine land. Think of it as asset bundling for images.

To run this example, enter the following command in your terminal.

```shell
grunt sprite:icons
```

That will generate the necessary CSS and the spritesheet image.
