# Introduction to Grunt

##### _(Appendix)_

This appendix details everything about Grunt that I didn't want to bloat the book with. You'll learn about tasks, file expansion patterns, task targets, how to configure tasks, and about creating your own.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
