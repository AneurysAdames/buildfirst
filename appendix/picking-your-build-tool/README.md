# Picking Your Build Tool

##### _(Appendix)_

This appendix explains that every tool has a purpose and helps you decide for yourself. In particular, I'll be covering [`npm run`][1] and [Gulp][2], and pitching them against Grunt, which you should already be familiar with. If not yet, you could read the [**Introduction to Grunt** appendix][3], or read through Part I of [the book][4].

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.

### Contents
